Installation convenience function. Helps with Giotto Suite installation from
the GitHub website by ensuring modules are installed in the correct order.
Also automatically switches to the R4.4.0 version when user R version is
lower than 4.4.1.\cr

This utility will do a full reinstall of the specified Giotto Suite modules
but non-Suite dependencies will never prompt to be updated.

\section{ref \code{"main"}}{

Installs the main Giotto version. This version is expected to chase the
highest R version.
}

\section{ref \code{"R4.4.0"}, \code{r440}, or \code{440}}{

Mirrors the main branch, but locks the R version at 4.4.0 (lowest version
supported by all dependencies)
}

\section{ref \code{"R4.1.0"}, \code{r410}, or \code{410}}{

Mirrors the main branch, but locks the R version at 4.1.0. This version
requires installation of \{Matrix\} 1.6-5
}

\section{ref \code{"dev"}}{

This version is ahead of the main version and also chases the latest R
version.
